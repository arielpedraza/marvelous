        <p>BANISHED to an alien dimension by the ruthless PROFESSOR VAR-X, and his apprentice, "display:visible-Woman", this motley group of misfits must put aside their differences, and FIGHT for SURVIVIVAL.</p>
        <p>Now, stung and disheartened by the revelation that their own names sound like cheap knock-offs of the manifold champions of THIS bizzare universe, they begin with their journey to categorize, collate, and share ALL knowledge (through a public Single-Page Web Application)... for the good of Mankind, and THE GALAXY!</p>
        <p>They are.... THE APPENDERS!</p>

          <h2><img src="images/devpool-1.png"/>  Devpool</h2>
          <p>Although Matt started out as a normal college student, Matt's life suddenly changed after being exposed to the raw power that developers possess.  With how amazing the software field looked compared to his previous studies of Engineering and Accounting, he could not hold back the desire to learn more; he left the college scene behind after only two years.  Matt went on to grow under the rigorous training of the Code Fellows, devoting his life to studying the art of coding.  By the end of the 301 trial, Matt then possessed the skills he needed to re-create himself: Devpool was born.</p>

          <p>Phelan Carey was a happy, young data-scientist, with a promising career at a leading software firm. Until one day, his talents drew the attention of the nefarious organization S-T-A-R-T-U-P. Captured, the years of tortorous experimentation and sub-optimal workflow changed him... WARPED him... Now, when provoked with large amounts of coding to do on an unreasonably short deadline, his mood rapidly worsens, transforming his mutant cells into a behemoth of pure RAGE.... THE INCREDIBLE FORK!</p>

          <p>Formerly a process engineer in manufacturing, Jeff was given a special serum which gave him special Linter powers.  Using his powers for good, he fights indent errors and missing curly brackets.  His alter-ego enjoys spending time with his family and getting outdoors.</p>

          <p>While serving in the Air Force, Ariel was sent to an unknown penninsula home to two countries still at war. After being stranded there for 3 times longer than originally planned, he honed his skills along the DMZ avoiding enemy capture and land-mines. With skills in computer hardware, he was able to secure a route home. Now he scours javascript code eliminating traces of ES5 function declarations while saying "You have failed this syntax!"</p>
